# WWDC2023 Swift Student Challenge Project
Voyage of the Star is a project about star exploration based on age, distance and apparent magnitude (relative brightness)
## Limitations
The challenge has different restrictions and the most important ones are:
- The project **must** be offline
- The zip version of the project can be up to 25 MB
- All must be included inside a Playground app (.swiftpm)
 
## Future Implementation

Some feature regarding to fetching data, are limited to proof of concept, since the previous requirement force a manual download and read of stars' data, but in future implementation without any restriction, data gathering can be handled building an API behind Space Governative Site.

## Data Source
Stars' data comes from ***NASA***, according to their [Media Usage Guidelines](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html) about Non Commercial Usage of their photo, and thanks to [***Aladin sky atlas***](https://aladin.cds.unistra.fr) developed at CDS, Strasbourg Observatory, France, distributed under GPL v3 licence
